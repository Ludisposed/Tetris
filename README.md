# Tetris

Your task is to implement an algorithm that places each new piece optimally. The piece is considered to be placed optimally if:

- The total number of blocks in the rows this piece will occupy after falling down is maximized;
- Among all positions with that value maximized, this position requires the least number of rotations;
- Among all positions that require the minimum number of rotations, this one is the leftmost one (i.e. the leftmost block's position is as far to the left as possible).

# Our new SCORE!

- No holes are created
- Lowest possible level
- (Make sure next piece fits, just like humans would) DIFFICULT
- (Go for tetris? 4 lines in a row, just like humans to get max score) DIFFICULT
- ??
