# Tetris 1.0

Your task is to implement an algorithm that places each new piece optimally. The piece is considered to be placed optimally if:

- The total number of blocks in the rows this piece will occupy after falling down is maximized;
- Among all positions with that value maximized, this position requires the least number of rotations;
- Among all positions that require the minimum number of rotations, this one is the leftmost one (i.e. the leftmost block's position is as far to the left as possible).

# Tetris 2.0

 - GUI (Tkinter)
 - Server (2 Player)
 - AI (AlphaTetris)
 - Difficult Levels (Random Piece type amount and startup levels)
 - Update Score System (Clean more levels one time with more Scores)
 - Clever console mode (haha I don't wanna keep wrong rotate all the time)
